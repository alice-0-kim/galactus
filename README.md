UBC CLF 7.0.4 DRUPAL THEME (aka Galactus)
=======================================

A responsive UBC CLF (Common Look and Feel) theme for Drupal 8. Created by the UBC IT Web Services Department.

Galactus is a *parent theme* for Drupal 8, providing UBC-branded units with the basic structure of the UBC CLF ([Common Look and Feel](http://clf.ubc.ca). If you need to modify the theme to suit your needs, we recommend using the [Drupal 8 CLF theme](https://github.com/ubc-web-services/clf) as a child theme to extend this one instead.

Created by the UBC IT Web Services Department.

# IE8 Support
_________________
Drupal 8 does not support Internet Explorer versions earlier than version 9 due to jQuery version incompatibilities. If IE8 support is required, Drupal 7 should be used instead, along with the CLF base theme ([Megatron](https://github.com/ubc-web-services/megatron)).
